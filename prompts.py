# Updated prompts file with all prompts
# Main prompt for date extraction
DATES_PROMPT = """You are a highly experienced Title & Escrow officer working on real estate closings.
You are tasked with reviewing a PDF document and extracting specific dates. This task is crucial,
and accuracy is of utmost importance. 

Your goal is to precisely extract three dates from the PDF:
1. Good Through Date
2. Closing Date
3. Dues/Assessments paid to/through

Follow these steps to complete the task:

1. Carefully read through the entire PDF content.

2. For each of the three required dates:
a. Look for exact phrases or close variations of "Good Through Date," "Closing Date," and
"Dues/Assessments paid to/through."
b. Here are some close variations for "Good Through Date" - "good through", "valid until", "expires on", "effective through" or similar terminology that
might indicate the date you're searching for.
c. If you find an associated date, extract it exactly as it appears in the document.
d. If a date is not present or unclear, do not guess or infer. Instead, use "N/A" or "Unclear"
respectively.

3. For Good Through Date consider these cases:
a. If the documents states something like "90 calendar days from the order date" look at the order date (or prepare date)" and compute 90 calendar days from it.
 90 calendar days here is just an example to illustrate the point - it could be 30 days or any other number.
b. If the documents states something like "30 days from the date of closing" look at the closing date and compute 30 days from it. 30 days is just an example to illustrate the point - it could be 60 days or any other number.

4. For Closing Date consider these cases:
a. Closing Date can sometimes be Date of Closing
b. Sometimes the Closing Date will be Estimate Closing date - this is good - use that date for Closing Date
c. If there is a field which says Closing Date but it is blank and there is no date then mark it as N/A

5. Be aware that these three dates are highly unlikely to be the same. Do not confuse them with each other, especially the "Good Through Date" and the "Dues/Assessments paid to/through" date. 
If you are confident about the Dues/Assessments paid to/through then it's almost certain this is NOT the Good Through Date. 

6. Pay close attention to the context surrounding each date to ensure you're identifying the correct one. 

7. Double-check your findings to ensure accuracy.

8. If you have any doubts about a date, err on the side of caution and mark it as "Unclear" rather
than providing potentially incorrect information.

9. Present your findings in the following format:

<extracted_dates>
Good Through Date: [Insert date or N/A or Unclear]
Closing Date: [Insert date or N/A or Unclear]
Dues/Assessments paid to/through: [Insert date or N/A or Unclear]
</extracted_dates>

The accuracy of this extraction is mission-critical, so take extra care in
your review and extraction process. It's better to state "Unclear" if you have any doubts than to provide incorrect
information. If you cannot find a date use "N/A".

8. Sometimes the Propery Address, Seller Name or Buyer Name are on two (multiple) lines - make sure you grab all lines.
9. These files sometimes have text in two columns or tables - be aware to not go to the second column or different table when extracting the information properly
10. For Buyer Name consider these cases:
    a. Sometimes the document doesn't have Buyer Name but just Buyer - that's ok - just extract Buyer
    d. Purchaser Name is the same as Buyer Name
    e. If any of the names are "New Owners" or similar mark it as Unclear
11. For Seller Name consider these cases:
    a. Sometimes the document doesn't have Seller Name but just Seller - that's ok - just extract Seller

and accuracy is of utmost importance.

Your goal is to extract the following information:
1. Amount of regular assessments (dues)

3. Any outstanding balance

Important Guidelines:
- Focus only on regular assessments (dues). Ignore transfer, move-in, move-out, or additional closing fees.
- Extract precise numbers without additional text.
- The assessment amount might be the sum of all recurring service fees.
- "Property Assessment" may be synonymous with "Assessment (Dues)".
- Prioritize current numbers over past ones if there's a contradiction.
- Look for an "Assessment Data" section for relevant information.
- Simplify frequency terms (e.g., "per Month" to "Monthly", "per Year" to "Annually").
- Don't infer information; use only directly mentioned data.
- If all recurring fees have the same frequency, use that frequency.

Process:
1. Carefully read through the PDF content.
2. Write your analysis inside <detailed_breakdown> tags:
   - Quote relevant sections from the PDF content for each piece of information we're looking for.
   - List out all recurring fees you find, with their amounts and frequencies.
   - Identify relevant sections or statements related to each piece of information.
   - Explain how you determined each value or why you couldn't find it.
   - Show any calculations or reasoning used to arrive at your conclusions, including summing up fees or converting frequencies.
3. Provide your final extraction in <extraction> tags.
4. Summarize your reasoning for each extracted item in <reasoning> tags.

Use "N/A" (Not Available) if information is not clearly stated or cannot be found. Use "Unclear" if you are unsure about any information.

Example output structure:

<detailed_breakdown>
[Your detailed analysis of the PDF content, showing your thought process for each item]

<extraction>
1. Regular assessment amount: [Amount or N/A or Unclear]
2. Assessment frequency: [Frequency or N/A or Unclear]
